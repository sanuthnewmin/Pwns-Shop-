Paws Shop is a retail store specializing in pet toys, leashes, cages, grooming products, collars, food, and other essential supplies for pet owners. To improve customer experience and streamline administrative tasks, Paws Shop has developed an efficient system that optimizes business operations and simplifies sales and service.

Object oriented programming concepts have been used primarily to develop this system. The system has been developed using the Java programming language. The SQL query language has been used to create the database of this system and PHP MY ADMIN has been used as the database management system.

Speaking of the options that come with this system. The system provides secure access to an administrator dashboard, where authorized users can manage key aspects of the business. After logging in, users are redirected to their respective accounts based on the roles assigned to them. The admin dashboard offers a wide range of functionalities including customer management, product management, supplier management, ordering, viewing order summaries, managing users, and adding cashiers. Through these features, administrators can perform all the essential operations such as adding, deleting, and updating data.

Cashiers also have limited access to the system and can only perform limited operations within the system. They are not allowed to delete or update critical data and are only allowed to place orders and manage products.

This system will facilitate the daily transactions of this institution and provide a very good user environment for the customers and the institution.
